WeighSwift - Portable Weighing Machine
Introduction
WeighSwift is a revolutionary portable weighing machine designed to address the challenge of under-loading/over-loading of railway wagons. This cutting-edge solution combines IoT devices with precise sensors to detect and alert about the weight of wagons during loading processes.

Problem Statement
The existing issue of under-loading/over-loading of railway wagons poses a risk to efficient operations and potential loss for CIL (Coal India Limited).

Solution
To tackle this problem, WeighSwift utilizes specific sensors integrated with efficient IoT devices. These devices detect the weight of wagons during loading, creating real-time alerts for loaders and ensuring accurate loading.

Features
Portable Load Cell Installation: Load cells are installed between rail tracks, calibrated for accuracy, and aligned with the driving wheel.

Real-time Data Generation: During the loading process, the load cell generates real-time data about the wagon's weight, displayed on the payloader's application.

Simultaneous Loading: Multiple payloaders can load simultaneously using the mobile app, ensuring efficient and coordinated loading operations.

Access Control: Contractors at railway sidings have an app to assign access levels to payloaders, managed through role-based access control.
